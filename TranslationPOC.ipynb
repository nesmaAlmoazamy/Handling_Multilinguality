The movement had to have an acceptable face of reputable reputable to the army and citizens. It was also the rank of the most senior member of the Free Officers. Major General Mohammad Najib, who dropped the king\\'s candidate in the elections for the Free Officers Club, and his valiant role in the 1948 Palestine war, was chosen twice and this choice was good because it was accepted by all parties. Farouq abdicled to his son Ahmed Fuad from the throne quietly and without resistance. On Saturday, 26 July, 26 July, the boat of Ras El Tin in Alexandria left the case of Farouk, his wife Nariman and his son, Crown Prince Ahmed Fouad, and less than a year later, in particular on 18 June 1952, the monarchy was abolished and the republic declared. The constituent committee of the Free Officers, headed by Gamal Abdel Nasser, who took the first two revolutionary actions on Sept. 9, was formed 47 days after the first movement of the Agrarian Reform Law and the Second Law on the Organization of Parties, which was issued in one day. Nasser, along with fellow members of the Revolutionary Command Council, then fought a battle against President Najib, who accused him of taking power. He was also accused of having links to the Brotherhood\\'s plot in the Manchia incident, and was exempted from the presidency of the republic on 14 November 1954. Thus, Nasser became the head of power. He entered the battle for negotiations with the English, who were occupying the Canal area, and reached the Treaty of Eniglio of Egypt and the departure of the last British soldier on 18 June 1956, and then his battle against the pressure of America to enter the Baghdad Pact under the pretext of protecting the region from the communist danger. In his ruling on the popular forces, Nasser adopted the beginning of the Liberation Organization, then the National Union, which changed to the Socialist Union under the concept of collecting the categories of the people within one framework supporting the ruler, who is fighting the enemies of the revolution. As a result, political action has tended to support peasants and workers at the expense of the Afghans and intellectuals, which has led to the deterioration of the middle class, which over the years has protected Egypt\\'s values, arts and manners. Abdel Nasser\\'s first global appearance at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in 1955, attended by leaders of 29 countries from Asia and Africa, was an opportunity for Nasser to meet popular leadership such as Indian leader Nehru and Chinese Prime Minister Xuan Lai and Indonesian President Sukarno. The participants in the conference represented more than half of the world\\'s population and represented the vigilance and cooperation of the peoples of Asia and Africa as a force against a world dominated by the Great Powers of America and the Soviet Union. In his view, the conference was an opportunity to promote the July Revolution, which did not emerge before the conference, through its six objectives: the eradication of colonialism, the eradication of monopoly and the control of capital, the eradication of feudalism, the establishment of a national army, the establishment of social justice, and the establishment of a democratic life. Who reviews history finds that the road to the June defeat started from the triple aggression on Egypt 1956 and then the unity with Syria 1958, which did not turn out for the project of development and then secession in 1961, since the Yemen war of 1962. Abdel Nasser made the decision to nationalize the Suez Canal in July 56 in response to the refusal of America and the World Bank to finance the High Dam, which gave Abdel Nasser a certificate of appreciation of millions over the decision. However, it was said that the decision of nationalization had no reason and that the channel would have returned to Egypt after 12 years according to its own agreement, but the nationalization was a moral, moral and psychological victory for millions of Egyptians in the face of the Great State. The victor of Syria was behind the decision of Egypt\\'s involvement in the Yemen war for five years, as a large number of our armed forces were martyred in a mountainous land and a guerrilla war, and the Egyptian army\\'s war was delayed and the Egyptian army manoeuvres retreated, and Egypt entered the June war without a shelter that would protect the Egyptian planes, because of the June war. The reason for the June war was to appease the people of Syria, and Israel was able to appease the people of Syria on 5 June during 3 hours, destroying 85 % of our weapons. The air, and once we came to the news that Israel had mobilized its forces on the Syrian front, confirmed that it was not correct 24 hours later, but the political leadership under the Syria complex decided to push the rest of our forces in Egypt, as if we were a superpower, to cross the channel to Sinai without having a clear mission based on attacking or defending, and for each of the two ways, plans and missions that did not exist. Thus, Egypt entered a war that was assumed by Israel and supported by America that we announced it while we were not ready for it, and its result changed the history of the conflict, and despite the October war, but the region is still paying the price. Despite the revolution\\'s desire to reform, it was sceptical of non-military, and reliance on them became \\\\\"people of trust\\\\\" in exchange for downplaying the people of experience. Nasser believed that political action and pluralism were impeding his social justice project, so he did not encourage free thinking and called the descriptions of the enemies of the revolution, the reactionary, and other qualities that had an impact on the thought of millions of people, so that he seemed to gain money. He is a thief who is sucking the blood of the people, thinking about the shadow of the day. However, he registered to Nasser that he faced the defeat of June with serious work in rebuilding the armed forces, which achieved the October victory later. Nor did he live up to his country, he helped other countries in their legitimate fight against colonialism. Most African countries witnessed Nasser\\'s role in liberating them. He also has his personality strength through his charisma, charisma and charisma. On 28 September 1970, his funeral witnessed millions of people who did not believe that he could die like all human beings and imagine that life ended as it remained until God had inherited the earth and the rest of it.\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"word_count\": 927,\\n  \"character_count\": 5241\\n}',\n",

Al-Nadeem participated in the Egyptian Army Revolution, the first to join the military formations of civilians, and was chosen by the leader of the revolution, Ahmed Araqi, to talk about the corrupt situation and the foreign influence, and he was critical of the Khadio Pasha, and in this regard, Nadim said, \\\\\" I declare the love of the ministry, and I condemn the tyranny in the country, and I condemn the tyranny of the country, and I condemn the tyranny of the ministry, and I condemn the darkness of the rulers, and I do not know them, and I do not know them except with the ignorance of the myths, and I do not care for them, and I do not care for them, and they do not care for them, and they fill the forums. When Kromer worked to foment sedition between the Copts and Muslims from the sons of Egypt, he was the first to confront him and the fact that many of the associations that included Muslim and Christian religious figures and intellectuals from Muslims and Copts began to spread the spirit of unity among the people of the Egyptian people to resist the sedition, which he tried to inflame the head of the English colonizer, and it was natural that he was angry at the head of the English colonizer, and the decision to exile him was once again to be away from Egypt because of the spirit of resistance and the struggle that he was broadcasting in the Egyptians. In Jaffa, Nadeem attacks the Ottoman Sultan, he is expelled and he goes to Astana and there is a meeting with the beauty of the Afghan religion to begin another journey of struggle and struggle. He wrote his famous book \\\\\"The Spikes\\\\\" in which he replied to what he said and written by the pharmacists who attacked Egypt hard, and because of this book, which was heavily attacked by the high door and the Ottoman authority, the prison nebula was deposited, but he was still sticking to the resistance as he was running away from prison to publish in the \\\\\"Brigade\\\\\" and \\\\\"Professor\\\\\", the most important newspapers in Egypt at the time.

In the first number 34, April 11, 1893, Al-Nadeem wrote an article about the relationship between the East and the West with enthusiasm, and the reader feels that he is a powerful wrestler who threw himself in a field, all of which are strong heroes. Al-Nadeem was forming a popular rally for the revolution, and he was the link between the leaders of the military revolution and those broad civil masses, and he worked to collect the popular signatures, which, Ahmed Araqi, represented the Egyptian people in front of the late Egyptian ruler, and Al-Nadeem, who visited villages, and Al-Kafur, and he was speaking at the top of his voice, using the gift of the feat that was given to him by God, and he was famous among the people for his speech, and he was famous among the people, and he was famous among the people, and he listened to his speeches and talk to him. Nadeem points to some of the paid pens, religious, scientific and industrial associations attributed to the Europeans and the spread of these associations in the East, and they have corrupted the relationship between the East and the West. If the East and the Europeans were left to enjoy the fruit of the mixtures, they were able to enjoy the fruit of love, and what led them to love and spoil the intentions and spoil the intentions of those writers who won the East and the West, and they saw the lies on it. If you were like us, we would have done the word of Europe, which is frequented by the names of the East, whenever it truly does, the royal colonization, or religious spread, and the copyright between the religious and property forces, so I made the first ambassador, the Safir, and the second is a executioner. He added every European king to the title of the King\\'s protection of religion. He says in his address to the king or emperor as well as the Christian religion. The nebula responds to the first charge that Europe has attached to the east, which is a charge of the \\\\\"delay\\\\\", and the nebula responds that it is the Europeans who wanted it to the east until it becomes a bank of their goods. The second charge is that the ethics of the East and its faith are one of the reasons for its delay. However, the East has been called upon to say this. They have committed a lot of taboos, imitating them to Europeans, not more or less. In this regard, Al-Nadeem says, \\\\\"By doing so, those who are not in these positions and scandals are neither eastern nor Western, and Europe has taken the means to implement its opinions and reach its destinations from the east.\\\\\" Is the East in desperate need of Western intervention? This argument is used by the West to colonize the East, and shows how the kings of the East themselves feared the people of the Lord, Baron, Count, etc., and did not try to promote the nation and raise it on the diet and defend the country\\'s rights. It did not return it with the useful or guiding newspapers in this way, and took the nebula balance between the European and its self-interest and its country on the one hand, and its country on the one hand, and its fears of the European danger on the other hand. Defending the Ottoman Empire defends the Ottoman Empire, he says, \\\\\"If this is a Christian religion, it is an Islamic state between eight Christian countries, and every country is a chant in a piece it occupies in the name of preserving its borders.\\\\\" But the religious hetero called for many of its kingdoms to be removed from their obedience. The Ottoman Empire blames the Ottoman Empire for giving the railway a commitment to the Europeans, who found it a way to intervene in the affairs of East Nations. For the body, the railway is one of the greatest ills Europe will take to intervene in the name of protecting the property of its followers. Al-Nadeem adds, \\\\\"We see many of the morons who have statesmanship in the name of Europe. They remind them of the power, lack of foresight, mismanagement, and the cruelty of rulers, and if they turn to say that they are the most steadfast, the best of them, and their best determination, they are at a point where the enemy of Europe is aggressive.\\\\\" Al-Nadeem reveals the means of the Europeans to seize the east on the pretext of reform and civil deployment, as France did in Tunisia and Algeria, where they had a law that violated Islamic law. It took judges subordinate to them to implement it. Russia also entered Maru, Herat and Bukhara under the pretext of protecting them from its enemies. She turned her into markets for the discharge of her goods. Her language was published there to execute the languages of death by death of religion, diet and national jealousy. England also entered Egypt by calling its people, on the basis of the support of the honorable center, and the formation of a stable government along the lines of the governments of Europe. It has done its best in improving and organizing by its discretion, and has not found the unears of Samah and the working hands. They also pushed the Egyptians away from service and shoved strangers into interests so that thousands of Egyptians could not find sustenance. They also played down Egyptian students in their schools and more than the use of foreigners in them. The nebula has poured blame on the Egyptians; their princes are mired in fun and luxury, and their minds are silent, and their exectation or intellectuals are not exposed to religion or politics. The Nebula does not direct the criticism of Europeans, saying, \\\\\" I do not blame the Europeans for this, they seek in their interests and the expansion of their kingdoms and their trade. The East sees them know for great works in their country, and they look at them with the view of the singer from death, and they do not move to match them or to stop the tide of their interference. They see them as robbing their hopes and loyalty work, and they are broken in their clothes, and they are not in their clothes, and they hear loud voices in their absence. They show them the voices of people who are keen on glory and honor. If they go to the roads, they will get their hands on their hands, and they are in their hands, and they are in their hands as the spoils of the spoils that are left to the sheds.\\\\\" Due to health conditions, or most likely political, to leave Egypt, and to the paradox of the newspaper in which he made his spelling, she was well exposed to his ideas and opinions. On the third of June, 1893, the Nadeem, in a speech entitled \\\\\"Salute and Peace\\\\\", invited the readers to thank the readers for their good care and demand for it. He told them that he had withstood a range of charges against him, including religious intolerance, and that he was a revolutionary editor, and that he had advised the actions of the Europeans, and thanked the newspapers that defended him against such charges as the pro-Al-Ahram newspaper, Al-Watan newspaper, and some foreign newspapers in Egypt and Europe. He concludes his article by saying, \\\\\"I would have if I had lasted my plate, but I had a weakness in it, and all the doctors referred to the change of air outside the Egyptian radius.\\\\\"\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"word_count\": 1232,\\n  \"character_count\": 7400\\n}',\n",

A A A box is among all the factors on which buyers build their decision to buy a new car, one of which is not comfortable, but for drivers who suffer from back pain and often drive long distances, they must also focus on the rest of the seats and support them for the back, and while finding the right seat may be a difficult task, we will give you a few tips that may make it easier to put it into the seat. Car, it\\'s one of the main factors in comfort levels that you\\'ll get, for example, sports cars usually have a low position, which increases pressure on the back, and so does some sedan and carcess, so you have to choose a more straight shape than a straight seat, so that it increases the stress on the back seat, and reduces the pressure on the back by evenly distributing it to the lower seat cushion, and finally, the longer seats also allow the easy seats to go out and get in the car. Support under this function. Feature for driver seats, where they can comfort people who suffer back pain, is always available as a choice even in cheaper cars, although they usually come as part of an optional package or higher class, and the lower back usually comes with some ability to modify it, as the base version provides increased support to the lower back area manually, while the most expensive cars provide an additional advantage to provide a comfortable drive, while the most expensive drivers need to have a deeper, lower, and lower end of the back, and the most luxe, and more luxe-capable. For modification, additional support to the driver\\'s thighs increases comfort, especially for long distances, and this feature is also present in many cars at different prices. The advantages of the other seat are more customizable, so while the seat adjustable is easier to find, there are usually no more comfortable seating, so there are not many manual seats normally except for sports cars, in addition to the coming of some electric seats with a memory feature for different preparations, which would be useful. The test of driving experience is the only way to know if the driving experience is the only way to buy it for your convenience, so it\\'s preferred to have a long driving experience for 20 to 30 minutes, so to make sure that you don\\'t feel any pain in the back, and show your interest in the convenience of the sales officer for time, so you know which cars with comfortable seats are available within your own budget.

First, in the morning trials, Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel and Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton were unable to record the fastest track of the wet track despite the continuous improvement, failing Perez\\'s other Ferrari driver, Kimmy Raikkonen, who was in second place with a margin of 0.50 seconds, while the Frenchman, including Esteban O \\' Keon, was the third team. For his use, Ricardo would be punished for using an engine developed from Reno. Following that, Renault\\'s driver Nico Hulkenberg was punished for returning ten points from the center of his progress in the qualifying round for tomorrow, which was punished for causing him in the second period. In the second period, the class saw a dramatic and strange scene, which was a high-speed crash for the Swedish driver, Marcus Ericsson, following which his cars were hit in the air after hitting them at the checkpoints. This is after the suspicion that the \\\\\"De Aras\\\\\" wing of the Sauber car failed to close after leaving the area allowed to open it. Marcos was transferred to the medical centre for mandatory routine checks, due to the strength of the incident, but the result was sound. The experiments were stopped for 20 minutes to remove the aftermath of the accident. The mechanics soon went to the other Sauber driver\\'s car, Charles Leclerer, to inspect a similar malfunction. DRS OPEN! - Formula 1 (@F1) August 31, 2018 Vettel seeking to reduce the 17-point margin with Lewis Hamilton, the top ranking of the championship, recorded the fastest time of one minute and 21.105 seconds. Luis Hamilton, the driver of the Mercedes team who raised the controversy following his defeat last week, came up with controversial remarks as he pointed out that Ferrari\\'s victory in the Belgian race was due to deception and that he used deceptive things in his car in the third place, while his teammate came in the team at the post.
