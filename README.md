# Machine Translation and  Multilinguality in Text classification.
This project is related to neuarl network course at the University of Tartu, Institute of Computer Science. Our project consists of two main parts:
1. Handling multilinguality in text classification
2. Expanding the available data with Round-trip-translation


# 1. Handling multilinguality in text classification:
In this part we will try three different ways for multilingual text classification, and compare between them. The three differet methods are:
1. Comparing Joint multilingual approach: we classify all of the languages together with single classification system (can be also ensemble of multilingual models)
2. Joint translated monolingual: all languages are translated into one super-language - prolly english - and then classified all together.
3. multiple monolingual classification approach: each language has a separate classification system trained to it.

# 2. Expanding the available data with Round-trip-translation:
This part involves testing how to best leverage the increased diversity that RT-translation brings to the data.
