Machine Translation and Multilinguality in Text classification
Description: The project consists of two parts: Handling multilinguality in text classification and Expanding the available data with Round-trip-translation
Handling multilinguality in text classification involves comparing Joint multilingual approach (we classify all of the languages together with single classification system (can be also ensemble of multilingual models)), joint translated monolingual (all languages are translated into one super-language - prolly english - and then classified all together), and multiple monolingual classification approach (each language has a separate classification system trained to it). In all of the three options, classes are same across all languages.
Expanding the available data with Round-trip-translation involves testing how to best leverage the increased diversity that RT-translation brings to the data. 
	Itâ€™s probably best to test both of the approaches with some SOTA approach.
Difficulty: Easy-Med (Easy on NN side, Med on amount of work involved side)
