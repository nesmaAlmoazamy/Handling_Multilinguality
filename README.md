# Machine Translation and  Multilinguality in Text classification.
This project is related to at the University of Tartu, Institute of Computer Science. 
Our project consists of two main parts:
*  Handling multilinguality in text classification
*  Expanding the available data with Round-trip-translation


# Datset: 
* [multilingual-text-categorization-dataset](https://github.com/valeriano-manassero/multilingual-text-categorization-dataset)



# 1. Handling multilinguality in text classification:
In this part we will try three different ways for multilingual text classification, and compare between them. The three differet methods are:
1. Comparing Joint multilingual approach: we classify all of the languages together with single classification system (can be also ensemble of multilingual models)
2. Joint translated monolingual: all languages are translated into one super-language - prolly english - and then classified all together.
3. multiple monolingual classification approach: each language has a separate classification system trained to it.

# 2. Expanding the available data with Round-trip-translation:
* This part involves testing how to best leverage the increased diversity that RT-translation brings to the data.
